To sign up for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Free Tier, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Google Account**: If you don't already have one, you'll need a Google Account to sign up for GCP. You can create one for free at https://accounts.google.com/signup.

2. **Navigate to Google Cloud Console**: Go to the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com/.

3. **Sign in or Create a New Project**: If you're not already signed in, sign in with your Google Account. Then, either select an existing project or create a new one. Projects are used to organize resources and manage billing in GCP.

4. **Enable Billing**: To use GCP, you'll need to enable billing for your project, even if you plan to stay within the free tier limits. Google requires a valid payment method to verify your identity and prevent abuse. However, you won't be charged unless you upgrade to a paid account or exceed the free tier limits. You can set up a budget and alerts to monitor your spending.

5. **Explore Free Tier Services**: Once your project is set up and billing is enabled, you can start exploring the free tier services available in GCP. These services include Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, BigQuery, and more. Each service has its own usage limits, which are typically sufficient for learning, development, and small-scale projects.

6. **Review Terms and Conditions**: Be sure to review the terms and conditions of the GCP Free Tier to understand the usage limits, eligibility criteria, and any other relevant information.

By following these steps, you'll be able to sign up for the Google Cloud Platform Free Tier and start using GCP services within the free usage limits. Remember to monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges, especially if you plan to exceed the free tier limits or use paid services.
